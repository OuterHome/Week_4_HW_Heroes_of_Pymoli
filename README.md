# Week_4_HW_Heroes_of_Pymoli

Ya'll know this already, but I highly recommend viewing the .ipynb jupyter notebook file within a local jupyter notebook, as the Github formatting (as static HTML, according to this link: https://help.github.com/articles/working-with-jupyter-notebook-files-on-github/), is not ideal. Please let me know if I should submit differently in the future!
